<h2 id="mOverview">Overview of processing</h2><p>The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing and refers to the data subjects.</p><h3>Types of data processed</h3>
<ul><li>Inventory data.</li><li>Contact data.</li><li>Content data.</li><li>Usage data.</li><li>Meta, communication and process data.</li></ul><h3>Categories of data subjects</h3><ul><li>Communication partners.</li><li>Users.</li></ul><h3>Purposes of processing</h3><ul><li>Communication.</li><li>Reach measurement.</li><li>Organizational and administrative procedures.</li><li>Feedback.</li><li>Profiles with user-related information.</li><li>Provision of our online offer and user-friendliness.</li><li>Public relations.</li></ul><h2 id="m2427">Relevant legal bases</h2><p><strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR: </strong>Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
 <ul><li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose or several specific purposes.</li><li><strong>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject.</li><li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data do not prevail.</li></ul><p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. This includes in particular the Act on the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission and automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, the data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
<p><strong>Reference to the validity of the GDPR and Swiss DSG: </strong>This data protection notice serves to provide information in accordance with both the Swiss DSG and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that the terms of the GDPR are used due to the broader spatial application and comprehensibility. In particular, instead of the terms "processing" of "personal data", "overriding interest" and "special categories of personal data" used in the Swiss DSG, the terms "processing" of "personal data", "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" used in the GDPR are used. However, the legal meaning of the terms will continue to be determined in accordance with the Swiss DSG within the scope of the validity of the Swiss DSG.</p>

<h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2><p>In accordance with the legal requirements, we take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>
<p>The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, disclosure, ensuring availability and separation of the data. We have also established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p>

<h2 id="m10">Rights of data subjects</h2><p>Rights of data subjects under the GDPR: As a data subject, you have various rights under the GDPR, which arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:</p><ul><li><strong>Right to object: You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If the personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.</strong></li><li><strong>Right of withdrawal for consents:</strong> You have the right to revoke your consent at any time.</li><li><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to request confirmation as to whether the data in question is being processed and to information about this data as well as to further information and a copy of the data in accordance with the statutory provisions.</li><li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> In accordance with the statutory provisions, you have the right to request the completion of the data concerning you or the rectification of the incorrect data concerning you.</li><li><strong>Right to erasure and restriction of processing:</strong> In accordance with the statutory provisions, you have the right to demand that data concerning you be erased immediately or, alternatively, to demand a restriction of the processing of the data in accordance with the statutory provisions.</li><li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to receive data concerning you that you have provided to us...
