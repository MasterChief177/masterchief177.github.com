### 🤖 Built with Transparency & Gemini 2.5 Pro

I believe in leveraging the best modern tools! A small disclaimer: **most of this code was written with the help of the Google Gemini CLI using the powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro model**.

It’s been an incredible assistant throughout the development process, and I’m happy to give a huge shout-out to Google and the Gemini model for making this project possible! Thank you for this amazing tool. 🙏

### ✅ Quality Assurance: Commit with Confidence

While AI is a powerful tool, final quality is always a developer's responsibility!

Before any commit is pushed to this repository, **I rigorously test the code in a live environment to ensure every feature is working exactly the way I intend.** You can be confident that the code you see here has been vetted and approved! 🚀
Since I’m still learning HTML, if you spot any bugs or have ideas for code refinement, I warmly welcome **pull requests and suggestions!** Let's learn and improve this together! 🧑‍💻
